                    We are team Recyclers and we are here to make a positive change
                    towards our loved planet, Earth. Our team is trying to make a movable 
                    dustbin to reduse waste. We have already tried making a prototype in the previous learning 
                    showcase, but it wasn't as convenient. So this time, we are back, with a better result, the movable dustbin. </p>

          <p><font size="7" face"Arial Narrow" color="black">We are making a movable dustbin which will move around classrooms 
                   looking for garbage. It will have a motion sensor on the lid of the dustbin which will open if it senses something. 
                   The base was made up of cardboard and was not stable enough to handle the bins. Thus, after some research,
                   we came up with a better idea, a base made up of wood. Similarly, in the first prototype, we used cardboard for the dustbin as well.
                   We recieved many suggestions and feedbacks from our friends, parents, and teachers. So this time, we are using stronger dustbins.</p>
                   

          <h1><font size="7" face"Arial Narrow" color="blue">How does it work?</h1>
          <p><font size="6" face"Arial Narrow" color="black">This dustbin moves on wheels. It will be coming to all the classes with the help of house keepers at regular intervals, to collect garbage. 
                   Once itâ€™s in your class, it will stand in the middle of the classroom to collect all the garbage. Till then, all the garbage that you have collected can be thrown in smaller bins beside each desk. 
                   That way, garbage can be dumped without disturbing the whole classroom. This bin can also be placed in places where children have lunch including the amphitheatre and chessboard area. 
                   We have also added a sensor which opens and closes the lid. When we put our hand in front  of the sensor, the lid opens and when we remove our hand, it closes.</p>

         <h1><font size="7" face"Arial Narrow" color="blue">How will we make it?</h1>
         <p><font size="6" face"Arial Narrow" color="black">We have already made the prototype. However, the real product would not be made up of cardboard.
 We are planning to make the product using metals like aluminium, steel, iron, etc, which we will collect from waste car parts from the nearest dump yard. 
The bin has two compartments: Wet waste and dry waste. The Dry waste compartment has the basketball hoop and the wet waste compartment has a lid so that the bin does not smell bad.
 We are really looking forward for your support.</p>
          
                    <h1><font size="7" face"Arial Narrow" color="blue">Where will we get the funds from?</h1>
                    <p><font size="6" face"Arial Narrow" color="black">We will get the funds by selling our product, we will get donations from people and investors. For donations, we will hang up posters on public walls etc. to advertise our product and get more donations.
                               That way, we will be able to collect some money and make the real product. By selling the product, we will be able to collect enough money to make more of these moving dustbins and can add more stuff to make it advanced.
